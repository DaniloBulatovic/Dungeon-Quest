# Dungeon Quest

A mobile VR escape room game for Google Cardboard VR developed using Unity.  

The game is envisioned as an escape room where the player explores the dungeon and tries to get to the end and find the golden goblet.  
The dungeon is filled with many challenges that the player has to overcome to advance, such as: unlocking doors, opening chests, pulling levers etc.  
There are also various items in the dungeon that the player needs to collect in order to progress further, e.g. the key that unlocks the door.

Movement through the dungeon is possible using teleportation or looking at the floor in the desired direction of movement.  
There are green panels on the floors of the dungeon that serve as teleporters.  
When the player looks at them long enough, they are teleported to that teleporter.  
Another way to move is by looking at the floor, where the player looks down at a certain angle, which allows movement in the direction of the view.  
This is a more intuitive and natural way of moving compared to teleportation.

Sound effects and background music have also been added to increase realism and provide a better player experience.  
Sound effects exist for opening doors, pulling levers, picking up items, opening chests, making potions, etc.  
Background music is present all the time during the game.
